## Spies and Stubs

A spy watches your code and records how many times a method was called, the arguments passed in, the return value, and even the value of `this`.

### Logger

Like `puts` in Ruby, `console.log` is hard to test. In fairness, you probably don't want to leave `console.log`s in your code and you probably shouldn't be testing them. But the idea is a simple representation of a much harder set of problems (e.g. did you fire an AJAX call?).

Here is our `logger`:

```js
function logger(message) {
  console.log('LOG: ' + message);
  return message;
}
```

Let's look at how we can use spies to record if a method was called. In `test/spy-test`, we have a simple `logger` function that delegates to `console.log`. We'll set up a spy on `console.log` and call the `logger` function to see if it was called.

```js
beforeEach(function () {
  sinon.spy(console, 'log');
});
```

We also want to make sure that we put everything back when we're done. Sinon will add some new methods to our spied on function. Here we'll use `restore`.

```js
afterEach(function () {
  console.log.restore();
});
```

Now, let's call the `logger` function and assert that `console.log` was called once.

```js
it('should log to the console', function () {
  logger('some message');
  assert(console.log.calledOnce);
});
```

### Testing Arguments

Again, our logger is super, super simple (and intentionally so). But let's make believe for a second that we needed to test it actually passes "LOG: ${message}" into `console.log`. We can use Sinon's `calledWith` method to analyze the arguments that were passed into the function.

```js
it('should log prefix the message with "LOG: "', function () {
  logger('some message');
  assert(console.log.calledWith('LOG: some message'));
});
```

### Testing Callbacks

Frequently, in JavaScript, we pass callbacks to as arguments to functions. You've probably done this in jQuery with AJAX. But, can we actually test

Here is our `fakeQuery` implementation:

```js
var fakeData = { ideas: [
  { title: 'Learn JavaScript', quality: 0 },
  { title: 'Test JavaScript', quality: 2 }
] }

var fakeQuery = {
  getJSON: function (url, callback) {
    setTimeout(function () {
      callback(fakeData);
    }, 1000);
  }
};
```

`fakeQuery.getJSON` takes a URL (which it immediately ignores) an anonymous callback function as an argument, makes believe that it's talking to the server for a moment, and then calls the callback with some fake data that it got from the non-existent server. Ideally, it's a simplification of what jQuery does without us needed in a server and all that jazz.

```js
it('should call the callback when it hears back from the server', function (done) {
  var spyCallback = sinon.spy(function () {
    assert(spyCallback.called);
    done();
  });

  fakeQuery.getJSON('/bogus', spyCallback);
});
```

There is a lot going on here. First, notice that the we passed `done` into the anonymous function passed to `it`. This tells Mocha to wait until the asynchrous call comes back before ending the test. We also need to make sure that the callback was called before—umm—test that it was called.

We can also make sure it was called with the `fakeData`.

```js
it('should call the callback with fakeData', function (done) {
  var spyCallback = sinon.spy(function () {
    assert(spyCallback.calledWith(fakeData));
    done();
  });

  fakeQuery.getJSON('/bogus', spyCallback);
});
```

### Stubbing

Sometimes we have things in our application that call out to external services. That's not the kind of thing we want running in our test suite. If we had a function that called out to the Github API, then our test suite would need an Internet connection to run and then use up our API calls. That's not good. We're better off stubbing the function and having it return some fake data that we can use.

Let's say that we have a `Twitter` module that makes requests out to Twitter over the network:

```js
var Twitter = {
  get: function () {
    // Crazy stuff happens over the network…
  }
}
```

Now, we may have functionality that we need to test that relies on this `Twitter` module. But, we don't want to call out to the server, right? Let's stub it!

```js
beforeEach(function () {
  Twitter.get.withArgs('/users').returns([
    { username: 'stevekinney', tweetCount: 5 },
    { username: 'jcasimir', tweetCount: 3 }
  ]);
});

it('should return the stubbed data', function () {
  var users = Twitter.get('/users');
  assert.equal(users[0].username, 'stevekinney');
});
```
